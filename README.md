#Node Cats

Express Routing and Heroku Deploy
We reviewed Node/Express in lecture today, building up another server from scratch. We added in our middleware and routes. We created some AJAX requests in our client side jQuery which pointed to those routes. Now let's take it a step forward.

Make a Routing Module for Cats
Given the lecture repo as a starting place, refactor the /felines routes into a separate routing module (js file). Adjust the server/app.jsfile accordingly to point requests to /felines into the new route module file. Your routing module should use a Router instead of the entire Express object. It also will need a variable to store the added cats.

Deploy to Heroku
We're going to do something brand new: deploy our node application to a third-party hosting platform. Heroku is a popular cloud-based hosting provider who supports Node apps.

Work through this guide to get your finished application up on a Heroku server. You'll need a Heroku account. Otherwise the guide will walk you through using their command-line program (using Terminal) to create a new app and to push your code up to its own Git server.

Please submit your fancy new Heroku URL (It will give you a domain name to use) and your Github repo link when you turn this in.
